# SealSlicer

SealSlicer is a slicer for 3d printing. I started this project because I was unhappy with every slicer I tried. It's called SealSlicer because seals are adorable and I love them. 

The goal is to eventually support multiple printing technologies, and MSLA will be the first.

## 🛠️ Current Progress

### ✔️ Mesh Rendering Engine
- Fully implemented and operational.
- Provides accurate and efficient rendering of 3D meshes.
- Currently using a basic Physically Based Renderering shader
- Really need to add an orthographic view and a button to change between ortho and perspective

### 🖥️ MSLA Mesh Slicer

- **Status:** Working but needs refinement
- Able to slice most objects correctly. 
- Generates image data that will be usable by a future g-code/printer file creator and ctb sdk
- Fully multithreaded, will use 100% of each core currently

### 🛠️ Printer Settings Module

- **Status:** Basic Functionality Implemented.
  - Load printer settings from `.toml` files for easy configuration, customization, and sharing.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - GUI for creating and editing printer profiles
  - Some way to actually select a printer, it is currently hardcoded

  ### 🫱🏿‍🫲🏻 User Settings Module

- **Status:** Basic Functionality Implemented.
  - Load user settings from `.toml` files for easy configuration, customization, and sharing.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - GUI for creating and editing profiles
  - Some way to actually select a profile, it is currently hardcoded

### 🖥️ Highly Responsive UI

- **Status:** Implemented.
- Slicing is currently blocking the UI while saving the debug images to the drive. :shrug:

### 🔄 Multithreading

- **Status:** Looking Good.
- Actively working on leveraging multithreading to enhance performance wherever beneficial.
- CPU Slicer is able to utilize all cpu resources. It's actually a bit of a hog but really fast. Might need to configure niceness/priority somehow

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

### 📝 G-code/3D Printer File Generator

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Generate G-code files compatible with MSLA resin printers

### 🖼️ G-code/Slice Images Viewer

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Visualize G-code and slice images within the application for better inspection and verification before printing.

### 🎛️ GPU Compute Slicer

- **Status:** Not working
- Needs to be updated to be in line with the way the CPU slicer works. Now that the CPU slicer is mostly working this might come soon

### 🖧 Network Printing

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Send files for printing directly to printers over the network.
  - This might actually not be possible with the current Chitubox SDK.

## 📊 Test Coverage

Trying to ensure robust and reliable functionality through comprehensive testing. Currently focusing on components not involving OpenGL. Testing anything related to OpenGL sounds like a literal nightmare

- **52.24% coverage, 676/1294 lines covered, +3.94% change in coverage**

## 🌟 Goals

SealSlicer aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient slicing solution for MSLA resin printers with the following objectives:

- **Mesh Rendering Engine:** Accurate and efficient rendering of 3D meshes.
- **CPU-only Slicer:** Normal slicing functionality using CPU resources.
- **GPU Compute Slicer:** Enhanced slicing performance leveraging GPU acceleration.
- **Printer Settings Module:** Easy configuration through `.toml` files.
- **G-code/3D Printer File Generator:** Direct generation of printer-compatible files.
- **G-code/Slice Images Viewer:** Visual inspection of slicing results.
- **High Responsiveness:** Ensuring the UI remains responsive during intensive operations.
- **Multithreading:** Utilizing multiple threads to optimize performance.

## 📝 Notes

- **GPU Slicing:** The GPU slicing component is broken currently
- **Responsive UI:** While the UI is currently responsive, slicing operations block the UI thread. Fixes are planned to resolve this.
- **Test Coverage:** Focused on ensuring reliability for non-OpenGL components, with ongoing efforts to increase coverage.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans include expanding compatibility, and adding user-friendly features like settings management and file visualization.
